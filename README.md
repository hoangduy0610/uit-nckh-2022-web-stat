## Description
<p id="description">The 4.0 Industrial Revolution with its basic characteristics of artificial intelligence and improved production efficiency is making great strides in development. It allows people to remotely control everything without limitations in space or time enabling faster better and more accurate interactions. Recognizing the difficulties and inadequacies inherent in managing a group our research team wishes to employ our expertise to support various settings including schools companies factories etc. with the goal of enhancing the quality of collective endeavors. We aim to combine and build a model to analyze the emotions of students and workers using the attendance machine. This will enable us to make the most accurate assessments of the learning and working environment.
